# Semiformal results

Semiformal results sit in between informal and formal results. There type or proposition is
defined, by the proof or definition is not.

## Note

The code here is modified from the `Util.ProofWanted` module of the Batteries library.

- proof in which the proposition is given but not the proof.
Semiformal results cannot be used in further code. They are essentially
forgot about after made.

With minor modification they act in a similar way to `proof_wanted`, however
they appear in PhysLean's TODO list and must be tagged accordingly.
They must also always have a doc-string. -/
