# Feynman diagrams

Feynman diagrams form a type into which permissible Wick contractions
embed.

A permissible Wick contraction is one which does not contribute zero to
the vacuum expectation value.

Feynman diagrams are based on multisets of `FieldOp`. This should be contrasted
with Wick contractions which are based on lists of `FieldOp`.

In particular a Feynman diagram is a partition of a Multiset into
disjoint pairs.
